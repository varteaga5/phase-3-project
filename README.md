# Phase 3 Project

## Welcome to my Phase 3 Project!

## Getting Started

In the application you can input the name of the food, then choose what category it falls under, and then add it to the list. You can then sort by a specific category and the application will show a list of the foods from the chosen category. Then if you have a change of taste and you wish to delete a food from the database, you can click the red delete button.

Check out my YouTube video for a demo of the app!
